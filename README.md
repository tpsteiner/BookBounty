## Configuration via environment variables

Certain values can be set via environment variables:

* __PUID__: The user ID to run the app with. Defaults to `1000`. 
* __PGID__: The group ID to run the app with. Defaults to `1000`.
* __readarr_address__: The URL for Readarr. Defaults to `http://192.168.1.2:8787`.
* __readarr_api_key__: The API key for Readarr. Defaults to ` `.
* __libgen_address__: The URL for Library Genesis. The only supported URL at present is `http://libgen.is`.
* __sleep_interval__: Interval to sleep between downloads (seconds). Defaults to `0`.
* __sync_schedule__: Scheduled hours to run e.g. 14 for 2pm (comma separated values in 24hr). Defaults to ` `.
* __minimum_match_ratio__: Minimum percentage for a match. Defaults to `90`.
* __selected_path_type__: Select Download Structure (file or folder). Defaults to `file`.
* __search_type__: Select Search Type (fiction or non-fiction). Defaults to `fiction`.
* __library_scan_on_completion__: Whether to scan Readarr Library on completion. Defaults to `True`.
* __request_timeout__: Timeout for requests (seconds). Defaults to `120`.
* __thread_limit__: Max number of threads to use. Defaults to `1`.
* __selected_language__: Filter download by languages (specific languages or all). Defaults to `English`. This is used if BookBounty is unable to get the languages from the Readarr Metadata Profile.
* __preferred_extensions_fiction__: Filter fiction download by extension (comma separated). Defaults to `.epub, .mobi, .azw3, .djvu`.
* __preferred_extensions_non_fiction__: Filter non-fiction download by extension (comma separated). Defaults to `.pdf .epub, .mobi, .azw3, .djvu`.
* __search_last_name_only__: Use only the author's last name in searches. Defaults to `False`.
* __search_shortened_title__: Use shortened title when searching (remove everything after `:`). Defaults to `False`.


## Sync Schedule

Use a comma-separated list of hours to start sync (e.g. `2, 20` will initiate a sync at 2 AM and 8 PM).
> Note: There is a deadband of up to 10 minutes from the scheduled start time.


## Readarr Integration

You have two choices to integrate BookBounty with Readarr:

1. Directly map `/bookbounty/downloads` to your main Readarr folder and configure `selected_path_type=folder`.   
   This method will attempt to create the correct folder structure (`/author/book/filename.ext`, etc.) before downloading files directly into their respective folders.

2. Alternatively, map `/bookbounty/downloads` to an `_unprocessed` folder and set `selected_path_type=file`.
   This method downloads all files into a single folder. After a library scan in Readarr, some files may remain unmapped and require manual import.  
   After importing, you can use the "**Rename Files**" function in Readarr to organize the files into the correct folders.

For both methods, setting `library_scan_on_completion=True` automates the import process in Readarr.

**Note:** Readarr does not automatically rename files upon import.
